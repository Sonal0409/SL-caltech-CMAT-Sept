Configuration Management with Ansible and Infrastructure as code tool - Terraform 
===========================================================
Day 1: Notes: 
===========================================================


What is Configuration?

 - making changes on a server so as to make your application run without any issues.
 Changes include like:
 - Creating new user
 - creation of directories
 - installing/upgrading/deletion of packages
 - Copying of files in a destination directory
 - running or stopping an application
 - setting on evironment variable or configuration files

Performing these changes on a single server is easy

If I ask you do it on 20 servers? Manually --> increase servers to 200 servers

Traditionally Configuration changes on various env like Dev, QA, prod 

  > was performed with help Shell scripts
  > different configuration for different envrionments
  > Really good at shell scripting
  > Maintain scripts, anyone who is not good scripting will find it diffuclt to read and understand the scripts
  > Shell are written seperatly for OS


Configuration Management: 

- It is a process for maintaining your VMs, servers or computers in a desired and consistent state.
- Ensure that the Vms continues to perform as expected.
- In case of any deviation we should be able to bring back the servers to its desired state.
- We desire to setup various servers with different changes automatically
- In devOps we dont use shell scritps to perform CM on various Env
- We make use of CM tools inorder to maintain consistency across the environments

Advantages of using CM tools:
===============================

> Easy to use, easy to learn, no special coding skills are required

> They will avoid manual errors while performing Configuration changes

> Easily manage multiple environments using CM tools

> Some times CM tool provides Common methods to apply changes on different OS

> CM code in Version control tool-> sharing your configuration code with everyone

> CM tools takes care of --> change Management also

	- maintain documents about what changes are being done on servers
        - which servers the changes are happing
        - which application/files/directories the changes will imapct
        - which user is doing the changes
> CM tool will help you to deploy your source code across your infrastructure
        

Examples of CM tools:
============================

Puppet
===============
-> Introduced in 2005
-> Obselete tool
-> community version & Enterprise version of tool is available
-> It is the oldest tool
-> Architecture is of pull approch
-> Linux & windows
-> code is written using puppet DSL
-> Architecture is little complex and set up is time consuming
-> Uses SSL for communication between various VM
-> puppet agent is to be installed on every Worker Node

Ansible
=================
-> New tool, stable
-> Open source tool
-> Product of RedHat
-> Can be installed only on Linux OS
-> Architecture is of push approch
-> code is written using YAML
-> Architecture is simple and set up is simple
-> Uses Open SSH for communication between various VM
-> No agent process is installed on worker nodes -> Agentless tool

Pull approach for CM tools:
===================================
- puppet
- chef
In pull approch changes are pulled by the agent nodes
Controller node will not be making any changes on the agent nodes
The agent nodes will poll for changes to controller node on a set polling schedule
If they are new configuration changes on Conctroller node, agents will pull them and apply on themselves.

Push approch for CM tools:
==================================
- Ansible
- Saltstalk
In push approch, the controller machine connects to the Worker nodes and apply the configuration changes
No agent process runs on the worker nodes
As the code is excuted on Controller machine, at the same time the changes are pushed on the worker nodes.
====================================

Ansible Architecture:
====================================

Inventory:
=======================

- simple files which has list of host servers Ip address, hostnames
- this file will tell you which servers to do the changes
- The default location is /etc/ansible/hosts
- However we can create our own inventory file based on application or environment
There are 2 types of inventory in Ansible:
- Static inventory -> manully create the file and manually update the list of ip address of host servers
- Dynamic inventory -> Servers on the cloud, automatically generate the inventory with list of Ec2 servers based on filter value.

Modules:
=====================
 -> python programs written in Ansible 
 -> pre written code available in Ansible
 -> Using these modules we can easily do changes on worker nodes
 -> We can also create our own modules using python
 -> Ansible will connect to its nodes and push out script whicha re called as "Ansible Modules" on them.
 -> In ansible there are 4000+ modules
 -> Default location of modules on Ansible Controller machine : /usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules
 -> Modules documentation is available at:
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.8/modules/list_of_all_modules.html
 -> Most of the modules needs some parameters that the user has to pass, in order to make specific chnages on worker node
For eg:

 copy(src=/tmp/file1 dest=/tmp/newfile)
 get_url(url=https://sample.url.com dest=/myapp/sample.war)


Ansible Configuration file:
===========================

> This file is available on every controller machine 
> The file has a name ansible.cfg file
> default localtion is /etc/ansible
> However we can create a custom ansible.cfg file
> This file consist of 2 types of parameters:
   > default parameters
   > privilage parmeters
> this files store information like:
   > location of inventory file
   > remote_user
   > ssh details
   > fork
   > permissions

Playbook:
========================

> Ansible code is written in playbook
> Written IN YAML
> 2 main information is written in playbook:
   > host details --> get the information from the inventory file
   > tasks details --> perform using ansible modules
> The ansible playbook can be made reusable and robust with concepts like:
   > Variables
   > loops
   > conditions
   > blocks
   > handling errors
Ansible + Linux server
=====================
> when a playbook is exeucted ==> Ansible converts it into a python program
> using SSH this python prgram is copied on each host server
> Ansible then exeuctes this program ==> thereby applying the changes

Ansible + windows host server:
==============================
Ansible connects to windows server via WINRM

Windows playbook is written in YAML==> converted to powershell script and it is copied on windows host servers using WINRM

if windows server has SSH we dont need winrm, ansible can directly copy the poewrshell script on the windows host

============================================================

In the SL CM Lab

1 Ansible controller machine
2 Worker nodes
